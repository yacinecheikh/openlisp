# Openlisp

A minimal but full-featured Lisp interpreter implemented in Python.

## Goals

Openlisp tries to be an easy to understand, edit and embed Lisp interpreter.

During development, I also tried to maintain a clean codebase for what would be an easy to understand and extend Lisp interpreter.

If you are interested in how the interpreter works, please read [the architecture documentation](./architecture.md).

Code examples can be found in the `source` folder. However, you are free to edit the builtins yourself and create the syntax you want.


## Status

The current progress can be checked in [the roadmap](./roadmap.md).
The interpreter and its subcomponents are complete, but some builtins are missing.
